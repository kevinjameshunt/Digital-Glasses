 *  as shown in the example app.
 *
 *  @note You can edit the lookup image found in FiltersExample/Resources using your favorite
 *  image editing application, but make sure to only apply effects to the lookup image that are
 *  independent of the surrounding pixels, such as Contrast, Brightness, Hue, Levels, Color Multiply, etc.
 *  The lookup image will not work with effects such as Vignette or Blur, because they are dependent upon
 *  the location of the pixels, and not simply on the color.
 *  Remember to save it as an uncompressed 512 x 512 png image when you're done.
 *
 *  @note Setting this property to nil will leave a plain, unfiltered camera.
